Some projects I've spent spare time working on

## DotGifIt

A java based implementation of a gif screen recorder, find the very first and only (so far) pre-release [here](https://github.com/sgregory8/dotGifIt/releases/download/0.1/dot-gif-it-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar)

To run make sure you have java installed and you've read the <a href="https://github.com/sgregory8/dotGifIt/blob/with_screen_moving/README.MD" target="_blank">README</a>; open up a terminal, change directory to wherever you've put the downloaded jar and run it!

```bash
java -jar dot-gif-it-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/sgregory8/dotGifIt)
